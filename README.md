# AutoEconomix Car Price Prediction Application

![Demo](./demo.gif)

## Overview
AutoEconomix Car Price Prediction is a Flask-based web application designed to accurately predict car prices using various attributes like make, model, year, mileage, and more. Leveraging  machine learning algorithms, this application offers a user-friendly interface for quick and accurate car valuation estimates.

## Getting Started

These instructions aim to direct you through the process of downloading, setting-up, and running the application properly, whether on a Windows machine or Mac.

### Prerequisites

What you need to use the application:

- Python 3.11
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

#### For Windows Users - Command Prompt:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/T-McKenney/AutoEconomix.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```
    cd AutoEconomix
    ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Navigate into the Model directory**

    ```
    cd Model 
    ```
   
7. **Run the ML Model on the Dataset**

    ```
    python train_model.py
    ```
   Don't move onto the next step until the model.pkl file has been created in the Model folder. You will know this step has completed when you see the 'Mean Absolute Error' printed to the console.


8. **Navigate to the Flask application folder**

    ```
   cd ..
   ```
   ```
   cd webapp
   ```

9. **Run the Flask Application**

    ```
    python app.py
    ```
    The application should take around 10 seconds to launch.


10. **Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in a web browser, where the Flask server is deployed**

    Once you make it to the web application, you will note the four visualizations generated by the application located at the bottom of the page. To generate a car valuation prediction, fill out every field of the HTML form and when done, click on the "Predict Price" button. The price estimation will be populated in red letters just below the button.




#### For Mac Users - Terminal:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/T-McKenney/AutoEconomix.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```
    cd AutoEconomix
    ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Navigate into the Model directory**

    ```
    cd Model 
    ```
   
7. **Run the ML Model on the Dataset**

    ```
    python3 train_model.py
    ```
   Don't move onto the next step until the model.pkl file has been created in the Model folder. You will know this step has completed when you see the 'Mean Absolute Error' printed to the console.


8. **Navigate to the Flask application folder**

    ```
   cd ..
   ```
   ```
   cd webapp
   ```

9. **Run the Flask Application**
